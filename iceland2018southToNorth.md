### Big Day of Hiking (13-16? mile Fimmvorduhals hike)
- Hike from Skogar to Thorsmork
- If I survive this day I can do anything!
- There is an emergency hut in the middle of the hike at Fimmvorduhals if I need to use it. Camping here is supposed to be tough because of the wind/altitude/exposure, so I am hoping to ,skip it.

- The reason I might do this is that Hrafntinnusker is not supposed to be an easy place to camp beacuse of the same issues described above.
